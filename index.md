## About Me

I'm Laxmi (aka Lux)! I am a 2022 [Illinois Computing Accelerator for Non-Specialists (iCAN)](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ican) cohort member at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a 2023 [NSF DREAM Fellow](https://cra.org/crn/2022/10/expanding-the-pipeline-distributed-research-apprenticeships-for-masters-dream/). 

In 2016, I received my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences from the University of South Florida. I spent the next several years conducting clinical research with an eye toward a future medical degree. After hours spent examining and compiling patient and practitioner narratives, I discovered I was more interested in developing malleable software to improve healthcare delivery than in providing healthcare. More broadly, my interests lie at the intersection of information systems and human-computer interaction.
	
When I'm not dreaming about revolutionizing healthcare delivery, I can be found with a good book and a cup of tea or out rowing on the Hillsborough River.
