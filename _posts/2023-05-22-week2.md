## Tools of the Trade

Last week, we focused mainly on getting familiar with tools of the trade: text editors, Linux OS, and SQL. This is my first time working exclusively with the Command Line Interface (CLI) without the support of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

After a year in Computer Science, I finally have an opinion on the great Vim versus Emacs debate. The first few days, I worked with Emacs on the recommendation of my research advisor, but I quickly realized that the commands are not intuitive for me. I found that there is a steeper learning curve for Emacs, than there is for Vim. Unlike Emacs, Vim comes with the handy `vimtutor` which has lessened the learning curve somewhat. I guess my allegiances have been decided. (`:q` let's you quit Vim *and* it makes more sense than `Ctrl+x, Ctrl+c`!)

I have also been learning how to use `sed` and `awk`, two Linux utilities. They are handy when parsing plain text data line-by-line. `sed` has been useful for simple search and replace and basic line editing. `awk` is more powerful, and has been useful for pattern-matching or extracting column information. Both have been powerful tools to add to my toolbelt in addition to other shell commands like `cat` and `touch`. 

Lastly, we have an in-house database of DOI extracted and processed from the Open Citations dataset (Peroni and Shotton, 2020) and loaded into a PostGreSQL table. It contains the DOI for 75,025,194 scientific publications and 1,363,605,603 edges between them. Consequently, working with this data requires some experience with SQL. I have been learning SQL basics, how to construct simple queries, as well as more advanced queries. 

## Learning Objectives

- EntrezAPI and PubMed
- Edge Lists, SQL Joins
- Data Visualization with Python
- LaTeX

## Journal Club

One of the graduate students working in the lab presented what he has been working on in lieu of the regular Journal Club programming. Over the past year, he has been working on a tool that, when given a graph partition or cluster from a clustering algorithm, improves the connectivity within the clusters.
